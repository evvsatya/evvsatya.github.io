## All about me
Hello this is E.V.V. Satyanarayana, I recently graduated from V R Siddhartha Engineering College in Vijayawada. I would like to strengthen and enhance my writing skills because I want to step in the software industry. So that I am prepared to tackle the challenges that lie ahead. I believe that this 21-days challenge will help me attain my goals.
