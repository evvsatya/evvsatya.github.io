 will suggest he decide first what he wants to study and graduate through the software or hardware side. As so many students join ECE because they think that if they join ECE they can either go software or hardware side. Yes, it is correct but in some perspectives, if he should be ready to face any challenges. Ece is a little bit harder than CSE. ECE involves core concepts if he can adapt and learn the core concepts easily he can go to ECE and he can also learn some programming languages. They will use for him in future like placements etc... If he has an interest in software but wants to select ECE for other reasons. I will suggest him to select CSE/IT because it is the best path for him to grow.
