SUBJECT: DELAY IN PROJECT
Hi, this is E.V.V.Satyanarayana, project manager of ABC Company. I am writing this mail to inform you about the delay in the submission of the project on time. The project got delayed due to some technical issues the work has been discontinued. I'm doing my best to finish it as soon as possible, but it will take some time approximately 1 week. Can you please grant me one more week extension in order to complete this project.

Yours Sincerely,
E.V.V.Satyanarayana,
